# Bangalore Traffic Time Estimator – Kiro Week 5

This project is built for **Kiro Week 5 Challenge: The Local Guide**.

It demonstrates a simple traffic time estimator that understands
**Bangalore's local traffic patterns** using a custom context file.

## 🚦 Project Idea
Bangalore is well known for traffic congestion, especially during peak hours.
This tool estimates travel time between popular locations based on
local knowledge instead of live APIs.

## 📁 Project Structure

bangalore-traffic-kiro  
├── .kiro  
│   └── product.md  
├── app.py  
└── README.md  

## 🧠 How It Works
- `product.md` contains Bangalore-specific traffic knowledge.
- `app.py` reads this file and uses it as local context.
- Traffic time is estimated based on the time of travel.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Kiro Custom Context (`product.md`)
